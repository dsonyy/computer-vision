# Computer Vision
Personal computer vision and deep learning notebooks:

- **Depth map** (work in progress) - calculate a depth map using multiple cameras in real time.
- **Webcam painting** - excercise program which makes you able to paint using colorful highlighters in the air:
- **Point stereo vision** (abandoned) - calculating the distance between two cameras and diode light.
- **OpenCV stuff** - miscellaneous notebooks to play with OpenCV.
    - **Getting started** - image/video input/output, drawing functions, basic operation on images, arithmetic operation on images.
    - **Image processing**, **Color detection** - real-time color detection using HSV ranges.
    - **HSV Palette** - simple and useful tool for picking HSV colors.
    - **Haar faces classification**
    - **Canny edge detection**
- **Thumbs up/down** (work in progress) - reimplementation of the image classification task from [Getting Started with AI on Jetson Nano](https://courses.nvidia.com/courses/course-v1:DLI+C-RX-02+V1/about) to be cross-platform and work with TensorFlow.
- **Camera test** - displaying image from cameras inside Jupyter notebook in real time.
